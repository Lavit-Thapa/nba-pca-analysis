# 🏀 NBA Player Stats & PCA: Uncovering Hidden Insights with Dimensionality Reduction! 🧠📉

Welcome to my exploratory project where **data science meets basketball**!  
Using real NBA player stats, I applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality, and retain meaningful insights from high-dimensional data.

---

## 📂 Dataset: `nba_final.csv`

This dataset contains detailed statistics for NBA players—covering performance metrics, physical attributes, and more.

### 🏗️ Features include:
- Points, assists, rebounds, field goal %, etc.
- Player position and team.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Use PCA to:
- 🔽 Reduce the number of features while retaining high variance

---

## 🧠 Why PCA?

In high-dimensional data like NBA player stats, noise and redundancy are common.  
PCA helps us:
- Cut dimensionality with minimal info loss
- Improve visualization and clustering
- Prepare for modeling with cleaner input data

## 🔬 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, handling nulls, and normalization
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selecting numerical attributes for PCA
3. **Applying PCA**
   - Using `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`

---

## 📊 Key Learnings

- PCA works best after normalization and mean-centering
- Even 2–3 principal components can explain a huge chunk of variance
- Great for compressing info without significant loss of patterns
- Helps detect structure in performance metrics across teams/roles

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** (PCA)
